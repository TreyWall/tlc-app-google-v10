# New Shelf Scanner Mobile App Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the New Shelf Scanner Mobile App. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the application meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.

## 2. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will include a combination of manual and automated testing.

- **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing and user acceptance testing will be performed manually.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests and UI tests will be automated using Jest and React Native Testing Library.

## 3. Test Environment

The application will be tested on:

- **Emulators:** Android and iOS emulators.
- **Physical Devices:** A range of Android and iOS physical devices to ensure compatibility.
- **Firebase Emulator Suite:** For testing authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Functions.

## 4. Automated Test Cases (Jest / React Native Testing Library)

Automated tests will be developed for key components and user flows. (Refer to `new-shelf-scanner-mobile/__tests__/` for test files)

- **Login Screen Tests:** (See `LoginScreen.test.js`)
  - Verify rendering of input fields and button.
  - Test successful login with valid credentials.
  - Test failed login with invalid credentials.
  - Test navigation after successful login.

- **Job List Screen Tests:**
  - Verify fetching and displaying of jobs.
  - Test rendering of job items.
  - Test navigation to Instructions screen on job selection.
  - Test handling of empty job list.

- **Instructions Screen Tests:**
  - Verify display of job instructions.
  - Test navigation to Camera screen.

- **Camera Screen Tests:**
  - (Requires camera mocking or a testing approach that doesn't rely on a physical camera)
  - Test button visibility (Take Picture, Retake Picture, Proceed to AI Review).
  - Test state changes after taking/retaking picture.
  - Test calling Cloud Function and navigation after taking picture.

- **AI Review Screen Tests:**
  - Verify display of parsed data.
  - Test editing of parsed data.
  - Test submitting reviewed data.
  - Test saving data to Firestore.
  - Test navigation to History screen after submission.

- **History Screen Tests:**
  - Verify fetching and displaying of job history.
  - Test rendering of history items.
  - Test displaying relevant job and review data.

## 5. Manual Test Cases

Manual testing will cover scenarios that are difficult to automate or require human judgment.

- **Installation and Setup:**
  - Install the app on different devices.
  - Verify initial setup and permissions.

- **End-to-End User Flows:**
  - Login with different user roles (if applicable in the mobile app).
  - Complete a full job workflow (login, view jobs, instructions, take picture, review, submit).
  - View job history.

- **Usability and User Experience:**
  - Evaluate the overall usability and flow of the app.
  - Check for responsiveness on different screen sizes.

- **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
  - Test error scenarios (e.g., no network connection, invalid input, failed Cloud Function call).
  - Test edge cases (e.g., job with no instructions, empty parsed data).

## 6. Test Execution

Automated tests will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline (for the admin app) and can be run locally during development. Manual testing will be performed periodically throughout the development lifecycle.

## 7. Reporting

Test results will be documented and any defects will be reported in a bug tracking system.
